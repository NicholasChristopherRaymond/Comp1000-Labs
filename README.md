LA01: 

Write a program to compute the sum, mean, and population standard deviation of a list of 5 numbers for
a user. First, ask the user for the user’s name. Have the user’s input go on the next line and have the
computer greet the user. Then have the user supply five numbers via the keyboard. For example: 1 2 3 4 5
Then, compute the sum of the numbers. In this case: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
The mean is another word for the simple average: 15 / 5 = 3
To calculate the population standard deviation takes a few steps. First, for each inputted value, compute
the difference between the mean and that number: (1-3) = -2, (2-3) = -1, (3-3) = 0, (4-3) = 1, (5-3) = 2
Then, add up the square of these differences: (-2)2 + (-1)2 + (0)2 + (1)2 + (2)2 = 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 10
Then divide this sum by the number of inputs: 10 / 5 = 2
And finally take the square root: √2 ~ 1.41
Have the computer say goodbye to the user at the end.
